			<h2>About سیاسات</h2>
			<p class="lead text-muted text-justify">
				The main aim of "سیاسات" is to develop a system for medium and large organizations to help them in managing policies and ensuring that the policy reaches the correct employees and make sure that he/she reads, understand, and acknowledge receiving it.
			</p>
			<p class="lead text-muted text-justify">
				A policy is written in a manner that is consistent with the standard followed in most organizations which includes a review process in which the administrators of a specific department write and review a policy. Then, the department head agrees to it, and then it is sent to an executive manager for approval and publishing.
